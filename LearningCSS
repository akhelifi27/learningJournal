CSS :

Selectors:
 we can use semantics
 classes we plug them in the html file and then refer to them in css 
 ids but we can use classes so no need 
* universal class 
we can plug it in html if we want to apply it to the entire page
we can use important and that will override other selectors and apply it to every paragraph or header
but that's unnecessary.
