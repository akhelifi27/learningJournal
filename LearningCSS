Selectors:
 we can use semantics
 classes we plug them in the html file and then refer to them in css 
 ids but we can use classes so no need

we can plug it in html if we want to apply it to the entire page
we can use important and that will override other selectors and apply it to every paragraph or header
but that's unnecessary.

background color
color for words
rgb(values,values,values) red green blue max 255  hex code #000000  F biggest value

Units and sizes: 
we can define pixels or width in header 
then do
